# User-Specific Email System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation allows each user to configure their own email settings (Titan email or any SMTP provider) so that when they send emails from the application, it comes from their personal email account rather than a shared system email.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema
- **`user_email_settings` table**: Stores per-user email configurations
- **Updated `email_logs` table**: Now includes `user_id` to track which user sent each email

### 2. EmailService Updates
- **Multi-transporter support**: Maintains separate SMTP transporters for each user
- **User email settings management**: Functions to save, load, and test user-specific settings
- **Fallback mechanism**: Uses default system email if user hasn't configured their settings
- **Caching**: Caches user transporters for better performance

### 3. API Routes
- `GET /api/email/user-settings`: Get current user's email settings
- `POST /api/email/user-settings`: Save user's email settings
- `POST /api/email/test-user-connection`: Test user's email configuration
- **Updated existing routes**: All email sending routes now use user-specific settings

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. UserEmailSettingsPage
- **Provider selection**: Pre-configured settings for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, and custom SMTP
- **Security**: Password field that doesn't expose existing passwords
- **Connection testing**: Real-time testing of email configuration
- **User guidance**: Built-in instructions for setting up app passwords

### 2. Email Integration
- **Automatic user detection**: Email system automatically uses the logged-in user's settings
- **Seamless fallback**: If user hasn't configured email, falls back to system default

## Security Features

### 1. Password Handling
- Passwords are stored in the database (should be encrypted in production)
- Frontend never receives the stored password
- Users can update settings without re-entering password

### 2. User Isolation
- Each user can only access their own email settings
- Email logs track which user sent each email
- No cross-user access to email configurations

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to "My Email Settings" page
2. Select your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Enter your email address and app password
4. Test the connection
5. Save settings

### For Gmail Users:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an App Password: Account Settings → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords
3. Use the generated app password in the system

### For Outlook Users:
1. Similar to Gmail, use an App Password for better security
2. Regular password may work but app password is recommended

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend:
- `migrations/create_user_email_settings_table.sql` - Database schema
- `migrations/create_email_logs_table.sql` - Updated email logs table
- `src/services/emailService.ts` - Enhanced with user-specific support
- `src/routes/emailRoutes.ts` - Added user settings routes and updated all email routes

### Frontend:
- `src/pages/UserEmailSettingsPage.tsx` - User email configuration interface

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Emails come from the actual user's email address
2. **Professional appearance**: Recipients see the sender's real email
3. **Better deliverability**: Using personal email accounts may improve delivery rates
4. **Audit trail**: Track who sent which emails
5. **Flexibility**: Support for any SMTP provider, not just specific services

## Next Steps

1. **Encryption**: Implement password encryption for production use
2. **Routing**: Add the UserEmailSettingsPage to the application routing
3. **Navigation**: Add menu item to access email settings
4. **Testing**: Run the database migrations and test the functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with email setup instructions

## Database Migration Commands

To set up the new tables, run these SQL commands:

```bash
# Create user email settings table
psql -d your_database -f migrations/create_user_email_settings_table.sql

# Update email logs table (if needed)
psql -d your_database -f migrations/create_email_logs_table.sql
```

The system is now ready to provide personalized email functionality for each user!
