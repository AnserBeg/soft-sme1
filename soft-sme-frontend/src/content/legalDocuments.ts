export const EULA_BODY = `This End-User License Agreement ("Agreement" or "EULA") is a legal agreement between you (the "User" or "you") and the provider of this web application ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). This Agreement governs your access to and use of our web application, including its integration with Intuit's QuickBooks API (the "Application" or "App"). By registering an account or using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the Application.

1. License Grant and Permitted Use

License Grant: Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Application for your internal business purposes. This license allows you to use the App's features (including QuickBooks data syncing, file uploads, and email integration) solely as intended by the Application's functionality.

Permitted Use: You may use the Application only in accordance with this EULA, our posted documentation, and any applicable laws and regulations. All use must be for legitimate business purposes within your own organization. You agree not to use the App in any way that harms us, our service providers, Intuit, or any other party.

2. Data Ownership and Access

Your Data: You retain all rights and ownership over the business data, files, and content you or your authorized users input, upload, or sync into the Application. We do not claim ownership of your data. By using the Application, you grant us a permission to use, process, and transmit your data only as necessary to provide the services (including exchanging data with QuickBooks and sending emails you initiate). This license to your data is limited to those purposes and includes the right to copy, store, and backup your data on our systems as needed to operate the App.

Company Materials: The Application (including all software code, libraries, and documentation) and all intellectual property rights therein are owned by the Company or its licensors. We only grant you the rights to use the App as expressly provided in this EULA. We reserve all other rights. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from our Application except as allowed by law or with our prior written consent.

3. User Obligations and Restrictions

3.1 Authorized Users: You are responsible for ensuring that all individuals whom you invite or allow to use the Application under your account (e.g. your organization's employees or agents) abide by this EULA. You must safeguard your login credentials and API tokens; do not share account access with unauthorized persons. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or security breach, you must promptly notify us.

3.2 Prohibited Activities: You shall not engage in or attempt any of the following:

Unauthorized Distribution: Selling, renting, leasing, sublicensing, or transferring the Application or your license to any third party is prohibited. You may not distribute or make the Application available as a hosted service for others without our permission.

Reverse Engineering: You may not reverse engineer, decompile, decrypt, or disassemble the Application, nor attempt to derive the source code of any software component, except to the limited extent allowed by law.

Modifications and Derivative Works: You may not modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Application. All customizations to the App must be explicitly authorized by us.

Illegal or Harmful Use: You may not use the Application for any unlawful, fraudulent, or malicious activities, nor to store or transmit any content that is illegal, defamatory, or infringes third-party rights. Use of the App must comply with all applicable laws and regulations (for example, you must not use it to send spam or to violate data export laws).

Interference and Access: You shall not interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Application or the data contained therein. Additionally, you may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the App or its related systems or networks (including data of other tenants in our multi-tenant system). The Application employs role-based access controls and multi-tenant data isolation to protect each customer's information, and you agree not to circumvent or abuse these controls.

No Misuse of QuickBooks Integration: You may only use the QuickBooks integration features of the Application with accounts you are authorized to access. You must not use the App to access or attempt to retrieve data from QuickBooks accounts for which you lack proper authorization.

4. QuickBooks Integration and Third-Party Services

The Application connects to QuickBooks Online via Intuit's official API to sync data between our system and your QuickBooks account. Your use of QuickBooks Online and any data obtained through the QuickBooks API is subject to Intuit's own Terms of Service and policies, which remain your responsibility to comply with qmusic.co. This EULA does not grant you any rights to use QuickBooks beyond what is provided under your agreements with Intuit. We are an independent service provider; we are not affiliated with or endorsed by Intuit. QuickBooks and Intuit are trademarks of Intuit Inc., and you must follow Intuit's terms when using QuickBooks features.

When using the Application's optional email integration or any other third-party service through the App, you are subject to the third party's terms (for example, the terms of your email service provider). We are not responsible for services provided by third parties outside of our Application. However, we will only exchange data with third-party services as necessary to provide the App's functionality and only with your authorization. For instance, if you configure SMTP email settings in the App, the App will use those credentials to connect to your email server to send messages on your behalf but will not disclose your credentials to any other party.

5. Security and User Data Protection

We take security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect the Application and your data. You acknowledge that the App includes features such as session management, encryption, and role-based access to safeguard data. You agree to use the Application in a manner that maintains security - for example, by choosing strong passwords, keeping credentials confidential, and logging out of sessions when finished.

The Application stores user credentials (such as passwords for your account on our App), session tokens, and QuickBooks OAuth tokens in an encrypted form on our servers. In particular, OAuth refresh tokens and any sensitive keys are encrypted at rest using strong encryption (e.g. AES-256) and are transmitted exclusively over HTTPS. We follow Intuit's security requirements for app developers, including encrypting stored QuickBooks OAuth tokens and never exposing them to client-side code or unauthorized parties developer.intuit.com. We never store your actual QuickBooks username/password, as QuickBooks integration uses OAuth tokens for access websterpacific.com. By using the App, you understand and accept that you are authorizing our Application to securely access and transmit your QuickBooks data on your behalf.

6. Termination of Use

6.1 By the Company: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Application (in whole or in part) immediately if you violate this Agreement, if your use of the App poses a security risk, or if required by law or Intuit's policies. We may also terminate this EULA and your access for convenience by providing you with reasonable prior notice (e.g. if we decide to discontinue the App). In the event of any termination or suspension, we will attempt to notify you via the email on your account or via in-app notification, though in urgent cases we may suspend first and notify afterward.

6.2 By the User: You may terminate this Agreement at any time by discontinuing use of the Application and, if applicable, by closing your account. You can revoke the Application's access to your QuickBooks data at any time via your QuickBooks Online account settings (OAuth token revocation) or by contacting us for assistance websterpacific.com. Revoking QuickBooks access or deleting your account will disable or limit certain features of the App.

6.3 Effect of Termination: Upon termination of this EULA for any reason, the license granted to you will immediately end and you must stop all use of the Application. You must also destroy or delete any local copies of software or materials from the Application that you have in your possession, except for your own data that you have exported. We will handle your stored data in accordance with our Privacy Policy upon termination. In general, if your account is closed or access revoked, we will remove or anonymize your personal data and QuickBooks tokens within a reasonable time, except as retained in backups or as required to comply with legal obligations (see Privacy Policy for details on data deletion).

7. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company disclaims all warranties, either express or implied, regarding the Application and its performance. This includes, but is not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties that may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade. We do not guarantee that the Application will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. You assume all risk as to the results and performance of the Application. You understand that data synchronization (e.g. with QuickBooks) may not always be immediate or error-free, and you agree that we are not responsible for any issues arising from delays or errors in data transmitted to or from third-party systems (such as Intuit's systems).

8. Limitation of Liability

To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event will the Company (or its officers, directors, employees, or affiliates) be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Application qmusic.co. This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise).

In addition, our total cumulative liability for all claims arising under or related to this EULA or the Application will not exceed the greater of: (a) the total amount (if any) you paid us for the use of the Application in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (b) $100 USD. The existence of multiple claims will not enlarge this limit. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent disallowed by applicable law. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

9. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, awards, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with: (a) your use or misuse of the Application; (b) your violation of this Agreement or of any law or regulation; or (c) your infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any third party. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses). This indemnification obligation will survive any termination of this Agreement and your use of the Application.

10. Changes to this Agreement

We may modify or update this EULA from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on our website (and/or within the Application) and updating the "Effective Date" above. In certain cases, we may also notify you via email or in-app alerts. Your continued use of the Application after an updated EULA has been posted constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you must stop using the Application and may terminate your account as described in Section 6.

11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Alberta, Canada (without regard to conflict of law principles). All disputes arising from or relating to this EULA or the Application that cannot be resolved amicably between us shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Alberta, Canada, unless applicable law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any competent jurisdiction to protect our intellectual property or confidential information.

12. Miscellaneous

This Agreement (along with the Privacy Policy referenced below) constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Application and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings. If any provision of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of the Agreement will remain in full force. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of this EULA shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign this Agreement in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law.

By using the Application, you affirm that you have read this EULA, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms. If you have any questions or concerns about this Agreement, please contact us as described below.

export const PRIVACY_POLICY_TITLE = 'Privacy Policy';
export const PRIVACY_POLICY_EFFECTIVE_DATE = 'December 22, 2025';
export const PRIVACY_POLICY_BODY = `Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information Aiven ERP ("Company," "we," "our," or "us") collects when you use our web application (the "Application" or "App"), how we use and protect that information, and your rights and choices regarding your data. This Policy applies to the Application, including any services that integrate with Intuit QuickBooks and optional features like email integration. By using the Application, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use the App. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (see Changes to This Policy below). The current version will always be posted on our website. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.

1. Information We Collect

We collect several types of information in order to operate the Application and provide our services:

Account and Profile Information: When you register or your organization creates an account, we collect information such as your name, email address, phone number (optional), company or organization name, and other profile details. We may also record your role or permission level (for example, admin or user) within the Application's role-based access system. This info helps identify you in the system and allows multi-tenant support (isolating each organization's data).

Credentials and Settings: If you configure integrations or settings, we collect and store necessary credentials and configuration data. For instance, if you choose to set up email integration, we will store the SMTP server address, port, username, and encrypted password or token for your email account (provided by you) in order to send emails on your behalf. Similarly, when you connect the Application to your QuickBooks Online account, we collect the QuickBooks OAuth tokens (access token and refresh token) and your QuickBooks Company ID (Realm ID). All such credentials and tokens are stored securely in encrypted form.

Business Data You Provide: You may input or upload business data into the Application, such as transaction records, financial information, text notes, or file attachments (e.g., invoices, receipts, spreadsheets, or other documents). For example, if the App allows uploading expense receipts or importing data from CSV files, any such files you upload are stored on our servers as part of your account data. We collect whatever information you choose to enter into the Application's forms or upload via its features, which could include various business records or other personal information about your customers or employees (if you input it). We treat all such data as confidential and belonging to you or your business.

QuickBooks Data (Authorized Access): When you authorize the Application to connect with QuickBooks, we retrieve data from your QuickBooks Online account to provide the App's functionality. This may include company profile information (company name, address), accounting data (such as accounts, transactions, invoices, payments, bills, chart of accounts, vendor and customer lists, etc.), and other financial details that you permit through the QuickBooks API. We only fetch the data that is necessary for the App to function as described (for example, if the App's purpose is reporting, it might retrieve your accounting records; if it syncs invoices, it will retrieve invoice data). We do not receive your QuickBooks login credentials - the connection uses Intuit's OAuth 2.0 authorization. (Per Intuit's requirements, our App uses OAuth tokens and never asks for your QuickBooks password websterpacific.com.)

Usage Data and Device Information: Like many web applications, we automatically collect certain information about how you access and use our App. This includes:

Log Data: When you use the Application, our servers may record information ("log data"), including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, device type, operating system, referring URLs, pages or features accessed, date and time of access, and error logs or crash reports.

Cookies and Session Data: We use cookies and similar technologies to keep you logged in and to remember your preferences. Specifically, when you log into the Application, our system will set a secure, HTTP-only cookie containing a session identifier or token. This cookie does not contain personal data beyond what is needed for session management. It is used to authenticate your requests and maintain your session state as you navigate the App. Our cookies are secure and encrypted, and we mark them HttpOnly to mitigate the risk of client-side script access developer.intuit.com. We do not use tracking cookies for advertising purposes. (See Cookies and Session Management below for more details.)

Analytics Data: [Optional:] If we use any analytics services to improve our product (for example, tracking which features are most used), those services may collect aggregate usage data. Such data would typically not include personal identities and would be used solely to help us improve the user experience. We will update this Policy or provide an in-app notice if we introduce analytics that collect more than anonymous data.

Support and Contact Information: If you contact us for support or with an inquiry, we will collect the information you choose to provide in that communication (such as your contact information and a description of your issue or question). We may keep records of support communications to better assist you and improve the Application.

We do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information from you that is not mentioned above, such as Social Insurance/Security Numbers or credit card numbers, unless you explicitly input such information into the Application. We ask that you do not store highly sensitive personal data in the App unless it is necessary for the App's functionality. If you choose to input any personal data of third parties (for example, information about your customers or vendors stored in QuickBooks) into the Application, you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to use that data in this manner. We treat all user-provided data with care as described below.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

To Provide and Maintain the Service: We process your personal and business data to operate the Application's core functionalities. For example, we use your QuickBooks OAuth token and Company ID to pull your accounting data from Intuit's API and display it within the App for your use. We use your stored business data and files to present back to you in the Application interface and to perform any computations or reports the App offers. If you use email integration, we use your SMTP credentials to send the emails you compose or trigger through the App. All these uses are fundamental to delivering the features you signed up for.

To Manage User Accounts and Authentication: Your account and profile information (like name, email, roles) are used to authenticate you and manage your access within a multi-tenant environment. Role-based access controls leverage your user data to ensure you and your permitted colleagues can access your organization's data, while preventing unauthorized access by others. We also use session cookies and tokens to keep you logged in securely during your session (see Cookies below).

To Communicate with You: We use contact information (email address, etc.) to send you service-related communications. This may include confirmations of account actions (e.g., signup, password reset), notifications about important changes or alerts within the App, and responses to support inquiries. If you opt-in to receive newsletters or extra updates, we will use your email for that purpose as well. (You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.)

To Sync with QuickBooks: The core purpose of the Application is to integrate with QuickBooks, so we use the QuickBooks data we retrieve to display in the App or to push updates back to QuickBooks (with your authorization). For example, if the App allows you to create or edit records (invoices, transactions, etc.) and sync them, we will send that data to Intuit's API on your instruction. We only use your QuickBooks data in ways that you direct and that are necessary to provide the intended functionality. We do not use your QuickBooks data for any purpose unrelated to the App's features, and we do not share it with any third parties except the Intuit QuickBooks API itself (see Data Sharing below) developer.intuit.com.

To Ensure Security and Prevent Misuse: We may use information (like log data and user account info) to monitor for suspicious or fraudulent activity, verify compliance with this Policy and our EULA, and to detect/prevent attacks. For example, we might analyze logs to detect multiple failed login attempts or unusual API usage that could indicate a security threat. We also enforce session timeouts and other security policies using your data to protect accounts.

To Improve and Develop the Service: We internally analyze usage patterns to improve our Application. For instance, we might look at aggregated data on how often certain features are used or common points where users encounter errors, so we can enhance those areas. We also use feedback or support inquiries to guide development of new features. Any analytics or research we perform with your data is typically done on de-identified or aggregated information whenever feasible. Personal data is not sold or provided to external parties for their own analytics or marketing.

Legal Compliance and Enforcement: We may use your information as needed to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests. For example, if required by law to retain certain data or to disclose information in response to a court order, we will use and disclose data as necessary (see Data Sharing below for details). Additionally, we may use data to enforce our own legal rights or agreements (e.g., to investigate violations of our EULA or to defend against legal claims).

We will only use your personal information for the purposes above or for closely related purposes. If we need to use your information for any other purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy or obtain your consent as required by law.

3. How We Store and Protect Your Data

We are committed to ensuring that your information is stored securely and protected against unauthorized access or disclosure. Here are key aspects of our data security and storage practices:

Secure Infrastructure: The Application and its database are hosted on a secure cloud infrastructure with modern security measures. We use firewalls, network isolation, and monitoring to protect our servers. All communications between your browser and our Application are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS); in other words, HTTPS is enforced on all pages of the App to protect data in transit developer.intuit.com.

Encryption at Rest: Sensitive data (including passwords, session tokens, OAuth refresh tokens, SMTP credentials, and any other secrets) is encrypted at rest in our database or storage. For example, user passwords are stored as salted cryptographic hashes (we never store plaintext passwords), and QuickBooks OAuth tokens and SMTP passwords are stored using strong encryption algorithms (such as AES-256) so that they cannot be read even if our database were accessed without authorization. We follow Intuit's recommended best practices for token management by encrypting tokens and storing encryption keys securely developer.intuit.com.

Access Controls and Multi-Tenancy: We implement role-based access controls both within the Application's functionality and in our internal systems. This means that within the App, each user can only access data permitted by their role (for example, an "Employee" role might not see admin screens or other teams' data). On the system side, our administrators or support personnel have restricted access to user data - only authorized staff with a business need (such as troubleshooting an issue) can access your data, and even then, all access is logged and monitored. Our multi-tenant architecture is designed such that each organization's data is logically separated, preventing other customers from accessing your information.

Session Management: As noted, we use secure session cookies with attributes like Secure and HttpOnly developer.intuit.com. Sessions are typically tied to your login credentials and expire after a certain period of inactivity or upon logout. This reduces the window in which a stolen session ID could be misused. We also support user-initiated logout which clears the session.

Development and Testing: Our development practices ensure that production data is not exposed in non-production environments. We use sanitized or dummy data for testing whenever possible. Developers are trained in secure coding practices (TypeScript on both frontend and backend) focusing on preventing common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc. developer.intuit.com. Before releasing new features, we test for security issues and compliance with Intuit's security review standards.

Third-Party Security: Any third-party libraries or services we use (such as cloud hosting, database as a service, or email sending services) are vetted for strong security practices. For instance, if we use a cloud database, it will have encryption at rest and in transit. Service providers that might process or store any personal data on our behalf are bound by contracts to protect your information and to use it only for providing services to us.

Organizational Measures: Internally, we have policies and procedures to maintain security and privacy. This includes employee confidentiality agreements, regular security training, and incident response plans. We restrict administrative access to systems storing personal data strictly to personnel who need it. We periodically review our security measures and upgrade them as needed to address new threats or standards.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. However, we continuously update and refine our security practices to mitigate risks. In the unfortunate event of a data breach affecting your personal data, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We understand the importance of keeping your data private. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing or any other purpose. We only share your information in the following limited circumstances:

With Intuit QuickBooks (API Integration): Because our Application is integrated with QuickBooks, we share data with Intuit's QuickBooks API when you have authorized such sharing. For example, when the Application retrieves your accounting data, it does so by making secure API calls to Intuit's servers, sending your OAuth token and requests for specific data. Likewise, if you instruct the Application to create or update a record in QuickBooks, the relevant data will be sent to Intuit via the API. This sharing is strictly for the purpose of providing the App's functionality and occurs securely via Intuit's systems. We do not provide Intuit any more data than is necessary for these requests, and such exchanges are subject to Intuit's developer terms and privacy safeguards. Intuit is considered a third party in terms of receiving data, but we only share data with Intuit on your behalf and with your consent as part of using the QuickBooks features of our App. (Note: Intuit may separately collect certain usage info when you connect an app, per their policies, but that is outside our control.)

With Your Email Service (if configured): If you enable email integration in the Application, the App will connect to your specified email SMTP server or service to send emails that you compose or trigger. In doing so, it will necessarily transmit the content of those emails and any attachments, along with your sender information, through your email service. This is essentially the same as if you sent an email from an email client - your intended recipients and your email provider will see the data you send. We do not send those emails or their content to any other party besides the intended mail recipients and your email server. The SMTP credentials you provide are used only within the Application to log in to your email server. We do not disclose your SMTP username or password to anyone except as needed to the email server itself during the sending process.

Service Providers (Processors): We may share certain data with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf to operate and support the Application. These include, for example: cloud hosting providers (for servers and data storage), database providers, monitoring and error tracking services, backup storage providers, or email/SMS delivery services for sending notifications. We only share data with these providers to the extent necessary for them to perform their services to us. For instance, our cloud hosting provider will necessarily host the databases that contain your information, or an email sending service would have your email address to send a verification code. All such service providers are contractually obligated to safeguard your data, to use it only for providing services to us, and not to disclose it or use it for other purposes. We carefully select providers with strong security and privacy reputations.

Legal Requirements and Protection: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests (such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant). We may also disclose data if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability. We will, if legally permitted, attempt to inform you of any such demands for your data (for example, if a government requests your data) so you have an opportunity to object or seek legal protection.

Business Transfers: If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or reorganization, your data could be among the transferred assets or shared as part of the evaluation process. We would ensure that any such transfer is subject to confidentiality agreements and that your data remains protected. If a new entity assumes ownership of our business, we will require that your personal information continues to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and we will provide notice before any personal data is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

With Your Consent: In cases where you explicitly consent to or request data sharing with a third party, we will share your information as instructed by you. For example, if the Application introduces a feature to export data to another accounting system or to connect with a third-party app, we will only do so if you opt-in and agree to that integration. In such cases, we will make clear what information would be shared and with whom, so you can make an informed decision.

Importantly, outside of the scenarios above, we do not disclose your information to any third parties. This means we do not exchange your data for advertising purposes, we do not sell your lists or usage information, and we do not share your content or business data with any external party unrelated to providing our services. Our philosophy is that your data is yours, and our role is as a custodian processing it on your behalf.

Additionally, any third party with whom we share data (as described) is also required to adhere to applicable privacy laws and provide a comparable level of protection for your data. For example, Intuit imposes obligations on apps like ours to handle your QuickBooks data carefully developer.intuit.com, and we in turn ensure our service providers protect data to high standards.

5. Cookies and Session Management

Cookies are small text files stored on your device by websites or applications. We use cookies and similar technologies in a very limited and purposeful way:

Authentication Cookies: When you log into the Application, we set a secure session cookie as mentioned earlier. This cookie contains a session identifier (token) that lets our system know you have been authenticated. It is what keeps you "logged in" as you navigate different pages of the App. The cookie is tied to your account and is necessary for the App to recognize your requests. It is HttpOnly (meaning your browser should not allow JavaScript to read it, reducing XSS risk) and marked Secure (meaning it is only sent over HTTPS) developer.intuit.com. We do not include your username, password, or personal details in this cookie. The cookie expires after a certain period or when you log out, whichever comes first. If you close your browser without logging out, the cookie may remain for a short duration so you can resume your session, but it will eventually expire and require you to log in again for security.

Preference Cookies: We may use cookies to remember certain user preferences or settings, such as your chosen language (if our App is multi-lingual) or UI customizations. These cookies would typically persist longer than a session cookie so that your preferences are "remembered" on your next visit. They will never contain sensitive info, only a reference or setting (for example, a cookie that simply stores "darkMode=true" to remember a theme setting).

No Third-Party Advertising Cookies: Our Application does not use third-party advertising or tracking cookies. We do not engage in retargeted advertising or share cookie data with outside marketing platforms. Any cookies used are first-party (set by our domain) and are solely for the functioning of the service.

Analytics: If we use any analytics cookies or scripts, we will do so in a manner that does not identify you personally. For example, we might use a cookie to count unique visitors or see usage flows, but not to track individual behavior across other sites. If we introduce analytics that use cookies, we will update this policy accordingly.

Cookie Control: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies or notify you when a cookie is being placed. However, if you disable or refuse cookies from our site, the Application may not function properly, especially with regard to login sessions. Because our cookies are integral to security and authentication, we recommend allowing cookies when using our App. We do not provide a separate cookie opt-out for "necessary" cookies (like session cookies) because they are essential for service; we do not use any non-essential cookies that would require an opt-in under most privacy regulations.

In addition to cookies, we manage sessions on the server side. Our server will keep track of active sessions and their expiration. If you are inactive for a prolonged period, the server may invalidate your session, requiring you to log in again. This helps protect your account if you leave the session open. We also implement measures such as one session per user at a time (optionally) or the ability for you to view and revoke active sessions (as a security feature, if provided).

Overall, our use of cookies is minimal and focused on providing you with a secure and convenient experience. We do not use cookies to collect personal data beyond what you voluntarily provide or what is described in this Policy.

6. Data Retention

We retain your personal information and business data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In practice:

Account Data: For as long as your account is active, we will keep the information associated with your account. This is necessary to provide you with the service.

QuickBooks Data Sync: Any data retrieved from QuickBooks and stored in our system (for caching or display) will be retained as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. We may periodically refresh or overwrite this data when new data is fetched. If you disconnect your QuickBooks integration, we will stop fetching new data and you may request deletion of any stored QuickBooks-derived data from our servers.

Uploaded Files and Business Records: Data you have uploaded or entered will remain until you delete it or close your account. You typically have the ability to delete specific records or files within the Application. Removing them may not immediately delete all backups, but we will ensure such deletions are propagated in due course.

Logs: Our application logs and audit trails are retained for a limited time for troubleshooting, security analysis, and compliance purposes. Typically, raw logs are kept for a few weeks to months. We may retain summary data (e.g., number of logins per month) longer for analytical purposes, but that data would no longer include personal identifiers.

Backups: We perform regular backups of our databases to ensure reliability. These backups are encrypted and stored securely. Backup files are retained for a certain rotation period (e.g., 30-60 days) before being overwritten or deleted. Thus, even after you delete information from our live database, it might persist in encrypted backups for a limited time until those backups cycle out. We treat backup data with the same security as production data. If we restore a backup for disaster recovery, we will re-delete any records that you had previously deleted that might reappear due to the time of backup.

Legal Holds: If we are required to retain data due to a legal obligation or order (for example, preservation requests in litigation), we will retain the data for as long as instructed. During such a period, we would not delete data that is subject to the hold until clearance is given, even if you request deletion.

When your data is no longer needed for the above purposes, we will securely delete or anonymize it. If you choose to close your account or request deletion, we will delete or anonymize the personal data associated with your account within a reasonable timeframe, except to the extent we need to keep it for legal reasons (such as tax, accounting, or regulatory compliance). In cases where complete deletion is not immediately feasible (e.g., data in backups), we will ensure it is not readily accessible and will delete it as soon as possible according to our retention schedules.

7. Your Rights and Choices

We believe in giving you control over your personal information. Depending on your jurisdiction and the nature of the data, you may have some or all of the following rights regarding your data:

Access and Portability: You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and to obtain it in a commonly used electronic format. In many cases, you can directly view your information through the Application (for example, your profile info, or data you've entered). For anything not accessible, you can contact us to request it.

Rectification (Correction): If any of your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct it. You can update some of your profile data directly in the App. For any other corrections, contact us and we will make the correction where possible.

Deletion: You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. This is sometimes called "the right to be forgotten." You can achieve this in many cases by closing your account. If you close your account, we will delete the personal data associated with your account (except as noted in Data Retention above for backups or legal requirements). If you prefer, you can request that we delete specific data (for example, an uploaded document) or your entire account data. We will honor such requests to the extent we are not legally required to keep the data. Once deleted, your data (including any content, files, or QuickBooks information stored) will be permanently removed from our active systems, and we will not be able to recover it. Note: if you have connected our App to QuickBooks, deleting your account with us does not automatically delete any data in your QuickBooks Online account (since that data resides with Intuit). To delete QuickBooks data, you would need to do so from within QuickBooks itself.

Revoking Consent / App Authorization: Where our ability to process your data depends on your consent (for example, accessing your QuickBooks account via OAuth), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can revoke the Application's access to your QuickBooks data by disconnecting the app in your QuickBooks Online settings. This revokes the OAuth token and we will no longer be able to access your QuickBooks account websterpacific.com. You can also remove or update your email integration settings at any time to stop our App from accessing your email service. Revoking these accesses will limit or disable related features, but it's your right to do so.

Objection to Processing: In certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to object to our processing of your data or ask us to restrict processing. For example, if you believe we do not have a legitimate interest or legal right to use your data in a certain way, you can object. We will review such objections and respond in accordance with applicable laws. Generally, we do not use your data for marketing or anything outside of providing the service, so objections would likely be related to internal analytics or similar. We will honor valid requests to restrict processing (which might involve us storing the data but not using it until an issue is resolved, for instance).

Automated Decision-Making: Our Application does not make any significant decisions about you using algorithms or automated processing without human involvement. We do not profile users in a way that has legal or significant effects. If that ever changes, you would have rights to certain safeguards, but as of now, it's not applicable.

Complaints: If you have a concern or complaint about how we handle your data, we ask that you contact us first so we can address it. However, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory data protection authority (if one is applicable to you, such as in the EU or UK) or other regulators.

To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at the contact information provided below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure that we do not disclose data to an unauthorized person). We will respond to requests within the timeframe required by law (typically within 30 days for many jurisdictions) and will let you know if we need an extension or cannot fulfill a request for a legitimate reason (e.g., if it would infringe on another's rights or if you are asking for data we do not have).

Please note that deleting or restricting certain data may affect your ability to use the Application. We will explain any such impact when responding to your request so you can make an informed decision.

8. International Data Transfers

This section applies if our servers or team are located in a country different from where you reside. The Application is hosted on secure servers which may be located in [the United States/Canada/Other]. If you are accessing the service from outside the hosting country, be aware that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the hosting country and possibly other locations where our service providers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country, and in some cases, may not be as protective.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you are an EU or UK resident, we rely on legal transfer mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses to transfer your data to jurisdictions that may not have an adequacy decision. Our service providers are also contractually bound to uphold strong privacy protections wherever they are located.

By using the Application or providing us with information, you acknowledge this transfer, storage, and processing of your information in countries outside of your own. If you have questions about cross-border data handling, feel free to contact us.

9. Children's Privacy

Our Application is not directed to individuals under the age of 16 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 16, you should not use our Application or provide any personal information about yourself. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 16, we will take steps to delete such information promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can investigate and take necessary action.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this Policy. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as by posting a notice on our website or within the Application, or by emailing you if you have provided an email address for contact).

We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you access the Application to stay informed about our data practices and how you can protect your privacy. Your continued use of the Application after any changes to this Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the updated terms. If you do not agree with the changes, you should discontinue use of the Application and, if necessary, delete your account or opt out of the affected features.
