# CORS Error Investigation for Production Frontend

## Reported Error
The production frontend at `https://softsme.phoenixtrailers.ca` reports the following errors in the browser console when attempting to load conversations or perform authentication:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://soft-sme-backend.onrender.com/api/messaging/conversations' from origin 'https://softsme.phoenixtrailers.ca' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED
```

The same behaviour is observed for the login endpoint.

## What the Error Means
Browsers require a successful **CORS preflight** (`OPTIONS` request) before sending cross-origin requests. The error indicates that the preflight response did not include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so the browser halted the actual request.

While this looks like a CORS misconfiguration, it is usually triggered by one of these conditions:

1. **Backend did not respond** â€“ Any network failure (for example, a Render instance being offline) causes the browser to report a missing CORS header, because it never received a response.
2. **Backend responded with an error page** that did not include CORS headers (for example, a 500 HTML error generated before Express middleware runs).

## Current Backend Configuration
The backend already includes an explicit whitelist that allows the production origin `https://softsme.phoenixtrailers.ca` and sets the CORS headers for preflight requests:

- [`src/index.ts`](../soft-sme-backend/src/index.ts) sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and handles `OPTIONS` requests.
- [`src/app.ts`](../soft-sme-backend/src/app.ts) contains the same configuration for the alternative server entry point.

Because the allowed origin is correctly configured, the error message most likely indicates that the Render instance returned an error before Express could run its CORS middleware.

## Recommended Checks
1. **Verify backend availability**: Visit `https://soft-sme-backend.onrender.com/api/health`. If the service is down or returns an error, restart the Render service.
2. **Inspect server logs on Render**: Look for crashes or startup errors that could prevent Express from handling requests (for example, database connection failures).
3. **Confirm DNS/SSL status**: Ensure the Render service's certificate and domain are valid; certificate errors also lead to `net::ERR_FAILED` in the browser.
4. **Retry after service is healthy**: Once the backend responds successfully to the health check, the CORS headers should be present and the browser errors should disappear.

If the issue persists after confirming that the backend is online and healthy, capture the exact HTTP response headers from the `OPTIONS` request (using the browser's Network tab or `curl -v -X OPTIONS`) to further diagnose whether any upstream service (such as Render's routing layer) is stripping the CORS headers.
