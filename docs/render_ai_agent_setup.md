# Render Deployment Checklist for AI Agent Temporary Storage

This guide summarizes the steps required to keep the AI agent from exhausting temporary storage when deployed on Render.

## 1. Provision Adequate Disks

1. Create a **Persistent Disk** in Render that is large enough to hold all downloaded model artifacts, Python wheels, and caches (recommend starting with at least 20â€¯GB for medium models).
2. Attach the disk to the service that runs the agent. Note the mount path (e.g., `/var/lib/render/ai-cache`).

## 2. Redirect Runtime Caches

Add the following environment variables to the Render service configuration so frameworks use the persistent disk instead of `/tmp`:

```bash
HF_HOME=/var/lib/render/ai-cache/huggingface
TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=/var/lib/render/ai-cache/huggingface
PIP_CACHE_DIR=/var/lib/render/ai-cache/pip
UV_CACHE_DIR=/var/lib/render/ai-cache/uv
XDG_CACHE_HOME=/var/lib/render/ai-cache
```

Create the directories during deploy by adding an init script, Render blueprint, or start command snippet such as:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HF_HOME" "$PIP_CACHE_DIR" "$UV_CACHE_DIR" "$XDG_CACHE_HOME"
```

## 3. Preload Critical Assets

When using Docker or Render Native environments:

- Extend the container image to download Hugging Face models and tokenizer files during the image build stage.
- Install Python dependencies (`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`) so wheels are baked into the image.
- If the agent relies on custom embeddings or knowledge bases, copy them into the image or persistent disk during build or a one-time migration job.

## 4. Maintain the Persistent Disk

- Periodically prune unused models or old cache entries (`huggingface-cli cache delete` or removing directories manually).
- Monitor disk utilization with Render's metrics; raise the disk size if sustained usage exceeds 80%.

## 5. Fallback Cleanup for `/tmp`

Keep a lightweight cleanup script that runs before agent start to remove stale files from `/tmp` in case the service accumulates temporary data during runtime:

```bash
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -mtime +1 -exec rm -rf {} +
```

Run this either in the start command or as a scheduled job.

## 6. Validate After Deployment

1. Deploy the service and monitor the first boot logs to confirm assets are cached to the persistent disk path.
2. Ensure the agent process has read/write permissions to the mounted disk.
3. Confirm total write volume to `/tmp` stays well below the partition limit during load tests.

Following these steps prevents repeated downloads from consuming Render's ephemeral storage, keeping the AI agent stable across restarts.
