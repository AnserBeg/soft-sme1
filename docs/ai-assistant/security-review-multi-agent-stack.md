# Security Review â€“ ReAct + Multi-Agent Stack

This document summarizes the security assessment of the upgraded SOFT SME assistant prior to general rollout. It captures the threat model, control validations, and outstanding follow-up actions.

## Scope
- ReAct orchestrator loop and planner integration.
- Multi-agent branching (researcher, executor, critic, voice subagents).
- Skill workflow persistence and execution APIs.
- Telemetry pipelines, guardrail compensation tasks, and evaluation harness storage.

## Threat Model Highlights
| Area | Risks | Mitigations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tool Invocation** | Unauthorized tool execution, prompt injection leading to sensitive queries. | Planner feature flags, RBAC on tool endpoints, guardrail critic enforcing revision requests, compensation queue auto-rollbacks. |
| **Skill Library** | Malicious workflows stored or tampered parameters. | Prisma schema validation, versioned skill approvals, verification callbacks, audit log entries on create/update/delete. |
| **Multi-Agent Coordination** | Cross-agent data leakage, conflicting instructions, denial-of-service via branching. | Deterministic runner limits branch fan-out, telemetry backpressure, branch voting rules, critic escalation on conflicts. |
| **Voice Subagent** | Transcript PII exposure, webhook spoofing. | Signed webhook verification, encrypted transcript storage, restricted ingestion allowlist, PII redaction job. |
| **Telemetry & Logs** | Sensitive data in logs, integrity loss. | Structured logging with field allowlist, encryption at rest, retention policies, checksum validation for evaluation exports. |
| **Guardrail Automation** | Unbounded compensations, privilege escalation through queued tasks. | Rate limits per tenant, task queue scopes, service account isolation, operator approval for high-risk compensations. |

## Control Validation Checklist
- [x] **Authentication & Authorization**: Confirmed service-to-service tokens for planner, orchestrator, and skill API. RBAC policies updated for new endpoints.
- [x] **Data Protection**: Database tables (`skill_workflows`, `skill_run_reflections`, `ai_conversation_reflections`) inherit encryption-at-rest and row-level access policies.
- [x] **Input Validation**: Planner validates tool parameters against JSON Schema; orchestrator sanitizes external inputs before execution.
- [x] **Monitoring & Alerts**: Latency, cost, and guardrail breach alerts routed to SRE on-call; security incidents notify security@ distribution.
- [x] **Change Management**: Rollout playbook approved; change tickets logged in governance tracker.
- [x] **Third-Party Dependencies**: Dependency scanning pipelines updated to include planner-service and voice subagent packages.

## Decisions & Approvals
- Security review conducted with engineering, SRE, and compliance teams on 2025-04-08.
- Approved contingent on maintaining monthly guardrail drills and quarterly security posture reviews.
- Voice subagent release limited to accounts with signed data processing agreements.

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Automate audit log export to centralized SIEM (target: 2025-04-30).
2. Complete penetration test of planner-service API before next major release.
3. Update vendor management records for voice transcription provider.

## Incident Response Updates
- Runbook `docs/ai-assistant/reports/phase4-synthetic-conversation-suite.md` now includes a security incident appendix.
- Added security contact rotation to operations calendar; weekly check-ins align with evaluation dashboard review.

## Residual Risks
- Prompt injection remains a monitored risk; rely on critic agent and guardrail compensations to minimize impact.
- Voice subagent transcripts could contain sensitive data; continuous redaction QA is mandatory.
